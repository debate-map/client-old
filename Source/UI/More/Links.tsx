### Canonical Debate Lab

The Debate Map project is being developed with the feedback of the Canonical Debate Lab group.

You're welcome to join our [Slack channel](https://join.slack.com/t/canonicaldebatelab/shared_invite/enQtMzEzOTU3NzYyMDY3LTI4YzUxM2I0MjFjZDNlMzQxZDM4YTgwNDNlMTY3YWQwNjJhYjk0ODE1MGU5NzQ2MTAyNTFhZWRhMGNjMjAxNmE) as we develop the model further.
We share news and project updates, conduct weekly Hangouts calls, and have frequent discussions on how to improve the debate-software model.

## Other websites

### Collaborative debating 

Hopefully, of course, you'll find this site the best option for debate-mapping -- and that through feedback we can resolve its remaining deficiencies.
For those wanting to see other options, however, the below is a listing of the best alternatives we're aware of. (most sites don't do this!)

Criteria:
* Layout format: how efficiently you can parse arguments and premises from the presented data.
* Contribution efficiency: how easy it is to create and edit content.
* Features: how substantial the features provided are.
* Momentum: how large/healthy the community is, and how much the project continues to be improved/developed.
* Open source: whether the source code is provided. (which allows for wider usage, and community-based improvement)

The numbers indicate how well the sites rank on each factor, segmented into levels/tiles. (lower is better)

### Others

The websites below don't really match the "collaborative debating" concept, but still relate in some way and may be found useful:
* [ProCon](http://www.procon.org): Presents various arguments on topics in a clear and impartial way, but does not allow improvement by users.
* [DebateWise](http://debatewise.org): About the same as the above, except with voting on the article and comments, but slightly lower quality.
* [Snopes](http://www.snopes.com): Fact-checking website, on a wide range of topics.
* [PolitiFact](http://www.politifact.com): Fact-checking website, focused mainly on politics.
* [FactCheck](http://factcheck.org): Also a fact-checking website. Does not seem as full-fledged as the previous two.
